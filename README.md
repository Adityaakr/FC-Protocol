# Monaris - FC Protocol

**Next-Gen Onchain Accounts, Credit & Treasury**

Monaris turns your income into an onchain account with balances, payments, cashflow, and an income-backed, under-collateralized credit line. On top, it runs an automated treasury that allocates idle funds into strategies with progressive liquidation protection.
